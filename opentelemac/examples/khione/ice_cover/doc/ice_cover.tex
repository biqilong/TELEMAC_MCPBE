\chapter{Presence of ice cover}
%
% - Purpose & Problem description:
%     These first two parts give reader short details about the test case,
%     the physical phenomena involved and specify how the numerical solution will be validated
%
\section{Purpose}
This test case has been purposefully setup to demonstrate that \khione is capable of correctly modify the hydrodynamics to account for the presence of an ice cover. 
Four variations of the same test case are shown here, where different ice cover conditions are set through made-up previous ice cover computation file. Water is running down a flat flume over 10km long at a gentle slope of 1:10,000. 
%Four different ice covers are applied to the water surface, the impact of which are compared with one another.
It should be noted that the heat exchange processes are not included. As a result, the tracers (temperature and frazil concentrations) are not activated and the initial ice cover remains unchanged throughout the simulation.

\section{Description}

\subsection{Geometry, mesh and bathymetry}

The domain is a long flat-bottom flume, boxed within (0;0) and (150;10,000), its length being $10$km along the x-axis and its width being 150m along the y-axis. The channel has a slope of 1:10,000 between the elevation 5m (upstream) and 4m (downstream).
The mesh of the domain was created as a triangulated regular grid with a uniform density of about 0.35~m, resulting in a mesh with 4,800 elements and 2,807 vertices. (see figure \ref{fig:cover_mesh}).

\end{figure}

\subsection{Initial conditions}
A first simulation is carried out for the hydrodynamics only to get to a steady state equilibrium.
An initial depth of 3.535m is set for all four variations of the test case. The free surface is subsequently corrected by \khione to account for the initial ice cover thickness, as read from the previous ice cover computation file.

%\subsection{Uniform ice cover}
%The first variation of the test case is set with a uniform ice cover throughout the length of the channel.

%\subsection{Downstream ice cover}
%The second variation is set with only a partial cover of uniform thickness, on the downstream part 4~[km] from the upstream boundary.

%\subsection{Upstream ice cover}
%The third test case is also set with a partial ice cover but on the upstream part 4~[km] of the channel.

%%\end{figure}
%
%\subsection{Representative ice jam}
%Last but not least, the fourth variation of the test case is set with an ice jam, with an ice thickness varying along the length of the channel. The following  figure (Figure \ref{fig:ini-cover_04}) shows coloured contours of the chosen ice thickness for each test case variation.

%It is noted that ice thickness x ice density = water layer thickness x water density.

\subsection{Boundary definitions}
There are two solid boundaries and 2 open boundaries.

The solid boundaries are on either side of the length of the flume, considered as solid walls with perfect slip conditions (condition 2 2 2).
The open boundaries are at (x=0) for the upstream and at (x=10,0000) for the downstream of the flume. A constant discharge of $300m^3/s$ is imposed at the upstream boundary. A constant water level is set at $7.535m$ at the downstream boundary.

\subsection{Coupling}
The simulation computes the shear stress and the local hydrostatic pressure due to ice cover from within \khione. The simulation is, therefore, coupled with \khione. Additionally, because some of the properties of water (such as density) are set within \waqtel, the simulation is also coupled with \waqtel, although none of its processes are activated.
\begin{itemize}
    \item\textit{COUPLING WITH = 'WAQTEL;KHIONE'}
    \item\textit{WATER QUALITY PROCESS = 1}, no processes activated within \waqtel
    \item\textit{ICE PROCESSES = 3}, effects of ice cover on the hydrodynamics computed within \khione
\end{itemize}
No tracers are necessary for this test case, although \khione will automatically add frazil concentration and temperature to the simulation.

\subsection{Physical parameters}
%
Physical properties are set through three steering files, for which \telemac2D is coupled with \waqtel and with \khione.
In order to balance the slope and the discharge through the flume, a Manning friction law is used, with a coefficient of $0.025$ (within the \telemac2D steering file). Within the \waqtel steering file, water and air specific heat are set to $1002J.kg^{-1}.K^{-1}$ and $4180 J.kg^{-1}.K^{-1}$.

Note that when ice cover is present, the flow can't be considered as a free surface flow anymore. 
This is a strong limitation that has not been overcome due to the complexity of modifying the shallow water equations to properly model constrained flows. Instead, hydrostatic assumption is still considered
and the effect of ice is taken into account as a static air pressure acting on the surface.
Thus, air pressure needs to be activated within the \telemac2d steering file in order to take the effect
of the ice cover on the pressure into account i.e.
\begin{itemize}
    \item\textit{AIR PRESSURE = YES}
\end{itemize}

The second important effect of ice cover onto hydrodynamics is the under cover friction source term.
It is taken into account via the following keywords in the \khione steering file:
\begin{itemize}
    \item\textit{LAW OF ICE COVER FRICTION = 4}
    \item\textit{FRICTION COEFFICIENT = 0.02}
\end{itemize}
Note that the friction law selected for the ice under cover is independant of the one used for the bottom.
In this case, we have chosen a Manning friction law, with a under-cover roughness of $0.02$.
When no additionnal keywords are provided, the friction coefficient is considered constant.
In some cases, the roughness of ice can be linked to the ice thickness. 
In that case, a linear law for the friction coefficient can be used via the LAW FOR FRICTION COEFFICIENT keywords, then the following formula is used:
\begin{equation}
C_i = \min \left( \max \left( C_{i0} \dfrac{h_i}{h_{e}}, C_{i0} \right), C_{im} \right)
\end{equation}
with $C_i$ is the friction coefficient, $C_{i0}$ the minimal friction coefficient,
$C_{im}$ the maximal friction coefficient and $h_{e}$ an equivalent ice thickness parameter set to $1mm$ by default. With this linear friction coefficient law, the following keywords are used:
\begin{itemize}
    \item\textit{LAW OF ICE COVER FRICTION = 4}
    \item\textit{LAW FOR FRICTION COEFFICIENT = 1}
    \item\textit{FRICTION COEFFICIENT = 0.02 ($C_{i0}$)}
    \item\textit{MAXIMAL FRICTION COEFFICIENT = 0.06 ($C_{im}$)}
    \item\textit{EQUIVALENT SURFACE ICE THICKNESS = 0.001 ($h_{e}$)}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Numerical parameters}
Only two numerical parameters are essential to the simulation. These are defined in the \telemac2D steering file:
\begin{itemize}
    \item\textit{TIME STEP = 5.}
    \item\textit{NUMBER OF TIME STEPS = 7200}
\end{itemize}
The total duration of the simulation is, therefore, 10~hours.

\section{Results}
The following figure shows a longitudinal profile of surface elevations along the full length of the flume, for the water surface (open water and under the ice), and the top of the ice surface, once the flow in the flume has reached a stationary state.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphicsmaybe{[scale=0.50]}{../img/profile_ice_cas0_-1.png}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Resulting free surface and ice cover}
    \label{fig:res-cover_01}
\end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\subsection{Uniform ice cover}
%Once steady state is reached, longitudinal cross sectional profiles are extracted from the results for the free surface (completely under the ice) and the ice cover.
%
%\begin{figure}[H]
%    \begin{center}
%        \includegraphicsmaybe{[scale=0.50]}{../img/l-section-res-cover_01.png}
%    \end{center}
%    \caption{Resulting free surface and ice cover}
%    \label{fig:res-cover_01}
%\end{figure}
%
%It is noted that, while the upstream boundary is a discharge boundary, the imposed level at the downstream boundary (less the ice cover thickness at the downstream boundary) sets the water level in the domain.
%
%\subsection{Downstream ice cover}
%Once steady state is reached, longitudinal cross sectional profiles are extracted from the results for the free surface (partially under the ice) and the ice cover.
%
%\begin{figure}[H]
%    \begin{center}
%        \includegraphicsmaybe{[scale=0.50]}{../img/l-section-res-cover_02.png}
%    \end{center}
%    \caption{Resulting free surface and ice cover}
%    \label{fig:res-cover_02}
%\end{figure}
%
%Again, the imposed level at the downstream boundary (less the ice cover thickness at the downstream boundary) sets the water level in the domain.
%
%\subsection{Upstream ice cover}
%Once steady state is reached, longitudinal cross sectional profiles are extracted from the results for the free surface (partially under the ice) and the ice cover.
%
%\begin{figure}[H]
%    \begin{center}
%        \includegraphicsmaybe{[scale=0.50]}{../img/l-section-res-cover_03.png}
%    \end{center}
%    \caption{Resulting free surface and ice cover}
%    \label{fig:res-cover_03}
%\end{figure}
%
%In this case, the water is free of ice on the downstream side, and the water is therefore set directly by the user.
%
%\subsection{Representative ice jam}
%Similarly, once steady state is reached, longitudinal cross sectional profiles are extracted from the results for the free surface (in the presence of an ice jam) and the ice cover.
%
%\begin{figure}[H]
%    \begin{center}
%        \includegraphicsmaybe{[scale=0.50]}{../img/l-section-res-cover_04.png}
%    \end{center}
%    \caption{Resulting free surface and ice cover}
%    \label{fig:res-cover_04}
%\end{figure}
%
%\begin{figure}[H]
%    \begin{center}
%        \includegraphicsmaybe{[scale=0.50]}{../img/frazil.png}
%    \end{center}
%    \caption{Water temperature and frazil growth along the flume}

\section{Conclusions}

The hydrodynamic of \telemac2D has been appropriately modified to account for the presence of the ice cover and for the additional shear stress observed at the interface between the ice cover and the water.
