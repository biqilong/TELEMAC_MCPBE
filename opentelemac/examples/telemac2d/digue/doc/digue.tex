\chapter{digue: Flow over a breakwater}

\section{Purpose}

This test case is to demonstrate the capability of \telemac{2d}
to model a situation with a very steep bed thanks to a refined 
mesh.
Two pools are located downstream of the breakwater.
They induce flow regime transitions from super-critical to sub-critical flow.

\subsection{Approach}

The computational domain is a rectangle with flat bottom
and initially dry bed in which a 4~m high breakwater
with trapezoidal cross-section splits the domain into two zones.
Water is introduced in the area on the one side of the breakwater
until this one overflows.
The area protected by the breakwater, which includes 
two pools, is suddenly flooded.

\section{Description}

\subsection{Geometry and mesh}

The computational domain is a 1,232.5~m $\times$ 1,000~m rectangular channel.
A triangular non-structured mesh is constructed on this domain
and refined near the breakwater.
It has the following characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
\item 19,202 triangular elements;
\item 9,734 nodes.
\end{itemize}
Maximum size range: from 3 to 37~m.

Water depth at rest = 5~m

\subsection{Boundaries}

\begin{itemize}
\item Domain entrance: free depth and discharges imposed,
\item Domain outlet: free depth and incident wave,
\item Lateral boundaries: solid walls with slip condition.
\end{itemize}

Bottom: Strickler formula with friction coefficient = 55~m$^{1/3}/s$.

The mesh and the topography are shown on Figure \ref{fig:digue:Mesh} and \ref{fig:digue:Bathy}

\subsection{Physical parameters}

The model of turbulence is constant viscosity
with velocity diffusivity = 2~m$^2$/s.

\subsection{Numerical parameters}
Type of advection:
\begin{itemize}
\item Methods of characteristics on velocities (scheme \#1),
\item Conservative + modified SUPG on depth (mandatory scheme)
\end{itemize}

The type of element is linear triangle (P1) for $h$ and for velocities.

\begin{itemize}
\item Implicitation for velocities = 0.55 (default value),
\item Implicitation for depth = 1.0,
\item Solver: Conjugate gradient with solver accuracy = 10$^{-6}$.
\item Time step = 2~s,
\item Simulation duration = 14000~s.
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}
Even though the slopes of the breakwater are steep,
progressive flooding of the breakwater and overflowing
with mixed super-critical/sub-critical flow conditions are reproduced as expected.
The time when overflowing occurs is 12,000~s (see Figure \ref{fig:digue:FreeSurface}).

\section{Conclusions}

\telemac{2d} is capable of simulating the flooding of a breakwater
including the different flow regimes and regime transitions
it induces provided that the mesh is sufficiently refined.
Hydrodynamics are appropriately reproduced at each stage
of the flooding event (free overfall or flooded breakwater).
