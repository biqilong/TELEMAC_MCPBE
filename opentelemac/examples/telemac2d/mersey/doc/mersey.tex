\chapter{Mersey : Tidal flow in the Mersey estuary}
\section{Purpose}
To illustrate that TELEMAC-2D is capable of simulating the hydrodynamics
(tidal currents and water elevations) in an estuarial zone due to long
period tidal wave forcing, with the covering/uncovering of tidal flats.

\subsection{Approach}
This case simulates the flow in the Mersey estuary on the west coast of
England. Tide hydrodynamics in this area is complex, with large tidal
range (up to 9~m on spring tide), extensive intertidal areas and an unusual
tide curve: in the upper reaches of the estuary, the tide ebbs for a large
proportion of the tidal period, and then floods very rapidly.
A sinusoidal water elevation is prescribed at the maritime open boundary
to simulate a mean spring tide wave.
The river discharge is neglected at the upstream end of the model.

\section{Description}

\subsection{Geometry and mesh}
The size of the domain is 356000$\times$ 409500~m
Water depth at rest = 9.2~m

The mesh is dense in the river and at the mouth.
\begin{itemize}
\item 4490 triangular elements
\item 2429 nodes
\item Maximum size range: from 200 to 1500 metres
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Boundaries}
\begin{itemize}
\item Domain entrance $\dsp H=5.15+4.05\cos(\frac{\pi}{2}\frac{t}{44700}) $
\item Latteral boundaries: solid walls with slip condition.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Bottom}
Strickler formula with friction coefficient = 50~m$^{1/3}/s$.

The mesh and the topography are shown on Figure \ref{fig:mersey:Mesh} and \ref{fig:mersey:Bathy}

\subsection{Physical parameters}
The model of turbulence is constant viscosity
with velocity diffusivity  equal to 0.2~m$^2$/s

\subsection{Numerical parameters}
Type of advection:
\begin{itemize}
\item Methods of characteristics on velocities (scheme \#1),
\item Conservative + modified SUPG on depth (mandatory scheme)
\end{itemize}
The type of element is linear triangle (P1) for $h$ and quasi bubble triangle
for velocities.
\begin{itemize}
\item Implicitation for depth and velocities = 0.6,
\item Solver: Conjugate gradienton a normal equation with solver accuracy = 10$^{-3}$.
\item Bottom smoothing = 1
\item Time step = 50~s,
\item Simulation duration = 44700~s.
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}
The total volume lost is 0.2x10$^{-2}$~m$^3$ , in comparison to the initial volume in the domain (0.289417x10$^{10}$~m$^3$ ). The
error represents 7x10$^{-13}$ which is the machine precision. The final balance of water volume is excellent.
Figure 3.20.2 shows the water depths at high tide and low tide in the domain. Tidal flats are represented. On
the same figure are shown (bottom) the evolutions of the free surface elevation at four different points:
\begin{itemize}
\item at the open boundary (1), where the tide is regular and symmetric,
\item at the mouth of the Mersey river (2), where a small asymmetry of the curve and a drift in time is observed,
\item in the estuary (3 and 4), where the tide is very asymmetric and a significant drift in time occurs.
\end{itemize}
