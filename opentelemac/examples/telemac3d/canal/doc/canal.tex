\section{Description}
\bigskip
This study case verifies that \telemac{3d} is able to compute the free
surface evolution along a channel with bottom friction.

\bigskip
The chosen configuration is a straight channel 500~m long and 100~m wide
with a flat horizontal bottom without slope.
Three different cases are studied:
\begin{itemize}
\item A 2D computation using \telemac{2d},
\item A 3D computation with hydrostatic option,
\item A 3D computation with non-hydrostatic option.
\end{itemize}
In all cases, the flow establishes a steady flow where the free surface
is influenced by the friction on the bottom. \\
Note that the velocity diffusion is constant in horizontal direction
and equal to $0.1~\text{m}^2.\text{s}^{-1}$ with the non-hydrostatic 
option and with \telemac{2d} usage, whereas with the hydrostatic option, 
it is null. In the vertical direction, the turbulent viscosity uses 
Nezu and Nakagawa mixing length model for the two \telemac{3d} computations.

\section{Initial and boundary conditions}

\bigskip
This test is initialised by a steady flow (3D cases initialised 
from the 2D case result file, Figures 
\ref{t3d:canal:fig:veloH} and \ref{t3d:canal:fig:freeSurface}).

\bigskip
The boundary conditions are:
\begin{itemize}
\item For the solid walls, a slip condition on channel banks is used for the velocities,
\item On the bottom, Strickler law with friction coefficient equal to
50~$\text{m}^{1/3}.\text{s}^{-1}$ is imposed,
\item Upstream a flowrate equal to 50~$\text{m}^{3}.\text{s}^{-1}$ is imposed,
\item Downstream the water level is equal to 0.5~m.
\end{itemize}

\section{Mesh and numerical parameters}
\bigskip
The mesh (Figure \ref{t3d:canal:fig:meshH} and \ref{t3d:canal:fig:meshV})  
is composed of 551 triangular elements (319 nodes) with 10 planes  
regularly spaced on the vertical, to form prism elements.\\

\bigskip
The time step is 2~s for a simulated period of 4,000~s for the 2D computation
then 2,000~s more for 3D computations.

\bigskip
This case is computed both with the hydrostatic pressure assumption and the non-hydrostatic version. 
To solve the advection, the method of characteristics
is used for the velocities (scheme 1). The GMRES 
(Generalized Minimal Residual Method, scheme 7) is used to solve 
the vertical velocity.  The implicitation coefficients 
for depth and velocities are equal to 0.6.

For the 2D resolution, the conjugate gradient
is used for solving the propagation step (option 1) and
the implicitation coefficients 
for depth and velocities are respectively equal to 1 and 0.55.

\section{Results}

\bigskip
On Figure \ref{t3d:canal:fig:profiles}, the three free surface profiles corresponding to each
simulation are compared.
These three results are in good agreement.
We can also observe that the flow is completely symmetric without
any influence of the space discretisation.

%\section{Conclusion}

\bigskip
To conclude, \telemac{3d} is able to take into account correctly the bottom friction
term.
