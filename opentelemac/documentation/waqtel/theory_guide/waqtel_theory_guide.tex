\chapter*{Abstract}
This theory guide is mainly based on the translation of the TRACER principle note
``Outil de simulation 1-D MASCARET V7.1. Module de qualit√© d'eau TRACER. Note de principe''
written by Kamal El-Kadi-Abderrezak and Marilyne Luck and published in 2012
\cite{elkadi_tracer_2012} (ref: EDF R\&D-LNHE H-P73-2011-01786-FR).
It also includes the heat exchange with atmosphere subsection of the \telemac{3d} theory guide.

TRACER is the transport module of MASCARET, 1D free surface code.
It enables to simulate the evolution of several coupled tracers
(i.e. no retroaction on the flow).
TRACER computes the tracers concentrations with respect to hydraulic conditions,
boundary conditions, external sources and the biochemical interactions between tracers.\\

This note contains an explanation of the method to solve the advection-dispersion equation,
and its application to model water quality.

All the processes existing in TRACER were implemented for \telemac{2D} and \telemac{3D} through
a new module called \waqtel between v7.0 and v7.2.
A description of the available water quality modules is carried out:
\begin{itemize}
\item O$_2$ (dissolved oxygen, organic and ammonia loads),
\item BIOMASS (phytoplankton biomass and nutrients),
\item EUTRO (dissolved oxygen, phytoplankton biomass, nutrients, organic and ammonia loads),
\item MICROPOL (micropollutants and suspended matter),
\item THERMIC (water temperature),
\item degradation law,
\end{itemize}
and a reference to the AED2 library documentation is also given
for this water quality and aquatic ecology model.

\chapter{AED2 Module}

See the science manual of the AED2 model (water quality and aquatic ecology model)
available on the AED2 website:

http://aed.see.uwa.edu.au/research/models/AED/downloads/AED\_ScienceManual\_v4\_draft.pdf


\chapter{Degradation law}

WAQTEL enables to model the evolution of a tracer $C$ over time from an initial condition
according to a degradation law that is assumed to be 1$^{\rm{st}}$ order (i.e. a tracer decrease):

\begin{equation}
  F([C]) = -k_1 [C],
\end{equation}

where $k_1$ is the constant of kinetic degradation of the tracer $C$ (d$^{-1}$).
It is a parameter of the model.


\chapter{Conclusion}

WAQTEL can simulate the outcome of several tracers in a river or the sea
(by resolution of the advection-diffusion equation) possibly coupled
(\textit{via} source terms of the equation),
and also offers a structure that allows programming of water quality models.\\

This report first shows the method of resolving the equation of convection-dispersion
 and its application to modeling water quality.\\

Then, it introduces water quality modules available in the WAQTEL tool library,
that are the modules:

\begin{itemize}
\item O2, a simplified model of dissolved oxygen,
\item BIOMASS, a model of phytoplankton biomass,
\item EUTRO, a model of river eutrophication (dissolved oxygen and algal biomass),
\item MICROPOL, an evolution model of heavy metals or radioelements,
  taking into account their interaction with fine sediments (suspended particulate matter),
\item THERMIC, an evolution model of water temperature under the influence of atmospheric fluxes,
\item AED2, the water quality and aquatic ecology model,
\item a degradation law.
\end{itemize}

%In the future, the following tasks are expected to be addressed:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item enabling simulation of tracer transport in a hydraulic network that involves floodways,
%\item enabling a distinction to be made between minor riverbeds and major riverbeds
%  in studies of water quality,
%\item finally, taking account of the presence of dead zones (dead/storage zones).
%  This may be useful for river applications during periods of low water. 
%\end{itemize}
