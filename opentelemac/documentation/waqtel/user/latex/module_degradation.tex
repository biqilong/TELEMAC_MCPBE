\chapter{Degradation law}

%\waqtel simulates the evolution of one or several tracer(s)
%over time from an initial condition according to a degradation law
%that is assumed to be of 1$^{\rm{st}}$ order (i.e. a tracer decrease).

\waqtel can simulate usual laws for bacterial degradation with
$T_{90}$ coefficient(s):
time(s) required for 90\% of the initial bacterial population to disappear
or also described as the time for bacterial or viral concentration to decrease
by one log unit (hence the 2.3 coefficient below).
It is expressed in hours.

In other words, it simulates the evolution of tracer(s) $C$ over time from
initial condition(s) according to a degradation law assumed to be of
1$^{\rm{st}}$ order (i.e. a tracer decrease) with constant(s) of tracer kinetic
degradation equal to $\frac{2.3}{T_{90}}$:

\begin{equation}
  F([C]) = -\frac{2.3}{T_{90}} [C],
\end{equation}

with $T_{90}$ coefficient(s) described above, in hours.
\\

The user can decide whether a tracer follows such a law
with the keyword \telkey{LAW OF TRACERS DEGRADATION},
and the values 0 if no degradation or 1 if a decrease law
of kind bactoriological is applied (default = 0).
Thus, this keyword has to contain as many values as the number of tracers.

%Its constant of tracer kinetic degradation $k_1$ can be specified
%The 90~\% mortality time $T_{90}$ can be specified
The $T_{90}$ coefficient(s) can be specified
with the keyword \telkey{COEFFICIENT 1 FOR LAW OF TRACERS DEGRADATION}
(one per tracer, expressed in hours).
