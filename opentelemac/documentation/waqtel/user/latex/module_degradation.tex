\chapter{Degradation law}

\waqtel enables to model the evolution of one or several tracer(s)
over time from an initial condition according to a degradation law
that is assumed to be 1$^{\rm{st}}$ order (i.e. a tracer decrease).

The user can decide whether a tracer follows such a law
with the keyword \telkey{LAW OF TRACERS DEGRADATION},
and the values 0 if no degradation or 1 if a decrease law
is applied (default = 0).

Its constant of kinetic degradation of the tracer $k_1$ can be set
with the keyword \telkey{COEFFICIENT 1 FOR LAW OF TRACERS DEGRADATION}
(one per tracer, expressed in d$^{-1}$).
